# Movie-Database-Website
A website connected to a MySQL website built using Python

It is based on the same database found here: https://github.com/aggelosmalchazos/SQL-movies-database

It connects to the database (you have to enter the proper credentials in the settings.py and app.py files after setting up the database). It runs in the 8080 port, but that can be re-configured if inconvient.

This project was completed for the course Design and Use of Database Systems, by professor Maria Roussou, Department of Informatics and Telecommunications(DIT), University of Athens (UOA). More information can be found here:https://www.di.uoa.gr/en/studies/undergraduate/27

This was a group project, in collaboration with my classmate Michail Prasinos.

Project utilizes MySQL Workbench 8.0 and Server.
